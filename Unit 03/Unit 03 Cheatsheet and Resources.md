## Unit 3 Cheatsheet


Here’s a quick reference sheet for Unit 3. While not an exhaustive list, it highlights the key syntax and concepts you’ll use in this unit, plus a few optional ideas that may help with problem-solving. You’re still expected to know required material from earlier units.
Sections are labeled for clarity:


- ✅ In-Scope: May appear on the assessment

- 💡 Not In-Scope: Useful, but not required


### 🎯 Unit Goals


- Insert variables and Python expressions into strings

- Index and access subsections of a string

- Loop over strings

- Solve problems involving strings, lists, dictionaries, or a combination of the three


### General Concepts ✅ In-Scope


### String Methods & Syntax


#### Lower Method


**`s.lower()`** Returns `s` as a lowercase string.[**Try it**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_lower.asp)


- Accepts no parameters

- Returns a lowercase string.


Example Usage:


```python
# Example 1: Mixed case
s = 'Hello World!'
lowered = s.lower()
print(lowered) # Prints 'hello world!'

# Example 2: All uppercase
s = 'HELLO WORLD'
lowered = s.lower()
print(lowered) # Prints 'hello world'
```


#### Split Method


**`s.split(seperator)`** Splits the string into a list along whitespace or specified separator. [**Try it**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp)


- `s` is the string to split

- Accepts one parameter `separator`: The characters along which the string will be split. This is an *optional* parameter. By default, the character is split along any whitespace.

- Returns a list of the substrings of `s` split by the specified separator.


Example Usage:


```python
# Example 1: Split along whitespace
s = 'Never gonna give you up'
split = s.split()
print(split) # Prints ['Never', 'gonna', 'give', 'you', 'up']

# Example 2: Split along specifed separator
s = 'Never-gonna-let-you-down'
split = s.split("-")
print(split) # Prints ['Never', 'gonna', 'let', 'you', 'down']
```


#### Join Method


**`s.join(x)`** Turns an iterable `x` into a string using `s` as a separator between elements in `x`. [**Try it**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp)


- `s` is the separator placed between items in the specified iterable

- Accepts one parameter `x`: the iterable whose items will be joined together into a string. This is a *required* parameter.

- Returns a string of the items in `x` separated by `s`


Example Usage:


```python
# Example 1: Join items in a list separated by space
lst = ['Never', 'gonna', 'run', 'around', 'and', 'desert', 'you']
joined = ' '.join(lst)
print(joined) # Prints 'Never gonna run around and desert you'

# Example 2: Join items in a list separated by dash
lst = ['Never', 'gonna', 'make', 'you', 'cry']
joined = '-'.join(lst)
print(joined) # Prints 'Never-gonna-make-you-cry'
```


#### Strip Method


**`s.strip(characters)`** Removes whitespace or specified `characters` from either end of the string. [**Try it**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_strip.asp)


- `s` is the string to remove whitespace or characters from.

- Accepts one parameter `characters`: the characters/substring to remove from either end of `s`. This is an *optional* parameter. If no value is specified, whitespace will be removed from the beginning and end of `s`.

- Returns the string `s` with whitespace or characters removed.


Example Usage:


```python
# Example 1: Strip whitespace
s = '       Never gonna say goodbye       '
stripped = s.strip()
print(stripped) # Prints 'Never gonna say goodbye'

# Example 2: Strip question marks
s = '????Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you?????'
stripped = s.strip('?')
print(stripped) # Prints 'Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you'
```


### Tuples


A [tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp) is a data type used to store multiple items in a single variable. In most cases tuples are used to group together 2-3 items. Tuples that store 3 items are sometimes referred to as a 'triple'. Tuples are commonly used to store pairs of data together or return multiple values inside a function.


Tuples are defined using round brackets.


Example usage:


```python
my_tuple = ("Mario", "Luigi")
print(my_tuple) # Prints ("Mario", "Luigi")
```

Like lists and strings, we can use indices to access elements of a tuple


Example Usage:


```python
my_tuple = ("Mario", "Luigi")
mario = my_tuple[0]
luigi = my_tuple[1]
print(mario) # Prints "Mario"
print(luigi) # Prints "Luigi"
```

Like strings, tuples are immutable, meaning we cannot update the contents of a tuple. If we update the contents of a tuple, we create a new tuple.


Example usage:


```python
my_tuple = (10, 20)
my_tuple[0] = 30 # Results in TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```


### Built-In Functions


#### Round Function


**`round(number, decimal)`** Returns a given number rounded to the specified decimal. [**Try it**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_round.asp)


- Accepts two parameters:

- `number`: the number to be rounded. This is a *required* argument.

- `decimal`: number of decimals to include in the rounded number. This is an *optional* argument. If it is not specified, it defaults to 0 and rounds to the nearest integer.

- Returns the rounded number.


Example Usage:


```python
# Example 1: Round to hundredth
x = 3.14159
rounded = round(x, 2)
print(rounded) # Prints 3.14

# Example 2: Round to nearest whole number
x = 3.14159
rounded = round(x)
print(rounded) # Prints 3
```


#### Enumerate


[**`enumerate(x)`**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_enumerate.asp) takes an [iterable](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Iterables.html) such as a list, dictionary, or string, and adds a counter to the function. It is often used to loop over the indices and values of an iterable simultaneously.


- Accepts two parameters:

- `x`: an iterable object such as a list, dictionary, or string. This is a *required* parameter.

- `start`: the value to start the counter at. This is an *optional* parameter. If no default value is specified, the counter will start at 0.

- Returns a sequence of numbers coupled with values in given iterable


Example Usage:


```python
# Example 1: Iterating over indices and characters in a string
my_string = 'code'
for index, char in enumerate(my_string):
  print(index, char)

# Prints:
# 0 c
# 1 o
# 2 d
# 3 e

# Example 2: Enumerate with start value specified
cereals = ['cheerios', 'fruity pebbles', 'cocoa puffs']
for count, cereal in enumerate(cereals, start=1):
  print(count, cereal)

# Prints:
# 0 cheerios
# 1 fruity pebbles
# 2 cocoa puffs
```


#### Zip


**`zip(x, y)`** takes two or more iterables and returns a sequence of tuples where each the first item from each iterable forms the first tuple in the sequence, the second item from each iterable forms a second tuple, and so on. It continues until it has placed all elements in the shortest iterable into a function. [**Try it**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_zip.asp)


Zip is useful for iterating over multiple iterables in parallel or for combining data from separate iterables.


- Accepts two or more parameters:

- `x`: an iterable object such as a list, dictionary, or string.

- `y`: an iterable object such as a list, dictionary, or string.

- Optionally accepts additional iterables to zip with `x` and `y`

- Returns a sequence of tuples pairing `x[i]` with `y[i]` where `0 <= i <= min(len(x), len(y))`


Example Usage:


```python
# Example 1: Zipping Two Lists
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
zipped = zip(names, ages)
print(list(zipped)) # Prints [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]

# Example 2: Zipping Lists of Different Lengths
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
zipped = zip(names, ages)
print(list(zipped)) # Prints [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]
```


### Comparing Strings and Lists


Python strings and lists function similarly in many ways, but there are also some major differences between the two data types. Below is a list of the key similarities and differences between strings and lists.


#### Similarities


- **Ordered sequences** Both strings and lists are ordered sequences of data.

- **Indexed by Integers** Both strings and lists can be indexed using integers (e.g. `lst[0]` or `s[0]`).

- **Slicable** Both strings and lists can be sliced to access a subsection of the string/list (e.g. `lst[1:3]` or `s[1:3]`).

- **Iterable** Both strings and lists are iterable meaning we can loop over them using a for loop.

- **Length** We can use the `len()` function to get the length of either a string or list


#### Differences


- **Content Type** Both strings and lists are ordered sequences of data, but strings are more limited in the type of data they can contain.

- Strings are an ordered sequence of character elements.

- Lists are an ordered sequence of elements that can be of any type, including integers, strings, and other lists.

- **Mutability**

- Strings are immutable, meaning they are not changeable. To update a string, we must create a new string.

```python
s = 'Try'
s[0] = 'C' # Results in TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

- Lists are mutable. We can update the content of a list without creating a new list.

```python
lst = ['T', 'r', 'y']
lst[0] = 'C'
print(lst) # Prints ['C', 'r', 'y']
```


### Bonus Concepts 💡 Not In-Scope


The following syntax is nice to know and may improve your code readability or help you solve certain problems more easily. However, they are not *required* to solve any of the problems in this unit. These are **not in scope for the Unit 3 assessment**, and you do not need to memorize them! Click on the function to read more about how to use it.


- [**`s.isalpha()`**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isalpha.asp) Returns true if all characters in given string are alphabetic letters (a-z).

- [**`s.isalnum()`**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isalnum.asp) Returns true if all characters in given string are alphanumeric (a-z or 0-9).

- [**`s.find(x)`**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_find.asp) Returns start index of the first occurrence of substring `x` in a given string. Returns `-1` if `x` is not in the string.

- [**`s.count(x)`**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_count.asp) Returns the frequency of the substring `x` in the given string.

- [**Sets**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp) A useful data type that allow you to group multiple pieces of data together. Data in sets is unordered, unchangeable, and cannot contain duplicates.
