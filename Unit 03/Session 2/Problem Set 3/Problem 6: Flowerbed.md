# Problem 6: Flowerbed

Imagine you have a flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. Flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.


Write a function `can_place_flowers()` that takes in an integer list `flowerbed` containing 0's and 1's, (*where 0 is an empty plot and 1 is a planted plot*) and an integer `n` that represents the number of new flowers wanting to be planted as parameters. The function should return `True` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `False` otherwise.


```python
def can_place_flowers(flowerbed, n):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1]
approved = can_place_flowers(flowerbed, 1)
approved2 = can_place_flowers(flowerbed, 2)
print(approved)
print(approved2)
```

Example Output:


```python
True
False
```
