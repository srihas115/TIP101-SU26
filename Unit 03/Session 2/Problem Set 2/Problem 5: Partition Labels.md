# Problem 5: Partition Labels

Write a function `partition_labels()` that takes in a string `s` as a parameter. `s` consists of lowercase letters and represents the order of characters as they appear in a document. The function partitions `s` into as many parts as possible so that each unique letter appears in at most one part, and returns a list of integers representing the size of these parts.


```python
def partition_label(s):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
s1 = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
print(partition_label(s1))

s2 = "abcabcbadefffeda"
print(partition_label(s2))
```

Example Output:


```python
# s1 partitioned into "ababcbaca", "defegde" and "hijhklij"
[9, 7, 8]
# s2 cannot be partitioned into more parts because of the "a" character at the end
[16]
```
