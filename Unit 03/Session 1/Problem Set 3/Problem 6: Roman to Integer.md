# Problem 6: Roman to Integer

Roman Numerals are represented by seven different symbols (`I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D`, and `M`) and have these corresponding values:


`I = 1` `V = 5`

`X = 10` `L = 50`

`C = 100` `D = 500`

`M = 1000`


For example, `2` is written as `II`, which is just two ones added together.

`12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`.

The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.


Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for `4` is not `IIII`. Instead, the number `4` is written as `IV`.


Because the `I` is before the `V`, we subtract it to equal `4`. The same principle applies to the number `9`, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:


- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make `4` and `9`

- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make `40` and `90`

- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make `400` and `900`


Write a function `roman_to_int()` that takes in a string `s` that makes up a roman numeral. The function should return the integer value of `s`.


```python
def roman_to_int(s):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
s = "XL"
print(roman_to_int(s))

s2 = "LVIII"
print(roman_to_int(s2))

s3 = "MCMXCIV"
print(roman_to_int(s3))
```

Example Output:


```python
40
58
1994
```
