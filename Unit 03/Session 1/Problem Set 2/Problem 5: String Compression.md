# Problem 5: String Compression

Write a function that takes in a string `my_str` as a parameter and performs basic string compression using counts of repeated characters.


For example, the string `"aabcccccaaa"` would become `"a2b1c5a3"`. If the compressed string does not become smaller than the original string, return the original string. Assume the string only has alphabetic characters.


```python
def compress_string(my_str):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
my_str = "aaaaabbcccd"
compressed_Str = compress_string(my_str)
print(compressed_Str)

my_str2 = "abcde"
compressed_Str2 = compress_string(my_str2)
print(compressed_Str2)
```

Example Output:


```python
a5b2c3d1
abcde
# did not convert my_str2 because `a1b1c1d1e1` is double the length
```
