# Problem 2: 3-Node Product I

Given the `root` of a binary tree that has exactly `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child, return `True` if the value of the root is equal to the product of the values of its two children. Return `False` otherwise.

```python
# Example Input Tree:
#   10
#  /  \
# 2    5
# Input: root = 10
# Expected Output: True

# Example Input Tree:
#   5
#  / \
# 3   1
# Input: root = 5
# Expected Output: False

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def check_tree(root):
	pass
```
