# Problem 3: 3-Node Sum II

Given the `root` of a binary tree that has at most `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child, return `True` if the value of the root is equal to the sum of the values of its two children. Return `False` otherwise.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def check_tree(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree #1:
  10
 /
10
Input: root = 10
Expected Output: True

Example Input Tree #2:
  5
 / \
3   2
Input: root = 5
Expected Output: True

Example Input Tree #3:
  5
   \
    2
Input: root = 5
Expected Output: False

Example Input Tree #4:
Empty Tree (None)
Input: root = None
Expected Output: False
```
