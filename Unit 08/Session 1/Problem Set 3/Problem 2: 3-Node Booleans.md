# Problem 2: 3-Node Booleans

You are given the `root` of a binary tree that has exactly `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child. The left and right child have a boolean value of either `True` or `False`.


The root has a string value of either `AND` or `OR`.
Apply the boolean operation of the `root` to its two children. Return `True` if the result of the expression is truth and `False` otherwise.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
# Example Input Tree:
#    'OR'
#    /   \
#   /     \
# True   False
# Input: root = 'OR'
# Expected Output: True

# Example Input Tree:
#    'AND'
#    /   \
#   /     \
# True   False
# Input: root = 'AND'
# Expected Output: False

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def tree_expression(root):
	pass
```
