# Problem 6: Interleave Lists

Write a function `interleave_lists()` that accepts two lists as parameters. The function should return a new list that combines the given lists by alternating which list it takes its next element from. It will take elements in order, and if one list is longer it will append the remaining elements to the end of the interleaved list.


```python
def interleave_lists(lst1, lst2):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
lst2 = [10, 20]
inter_lst = interleave_lists(lst1, lst2)
print(inter_lst)
```

Example Output:


```
[1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 4]
```
