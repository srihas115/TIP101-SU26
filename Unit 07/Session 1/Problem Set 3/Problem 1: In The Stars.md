# Problem 1: In The Stars

A recursive function is a function that calls itself within the body of the function.


Step 1: Copy the recursive function `insert_stars()` into your IDE and run it.


Step 2: Then create another function `insert_stars_iterative()` that produces the same output without using recursion or the built-in `join()` method.


Compare your iterative (non-recursive) solution to the recursive solution provided. What is similar? What is different?


```python
def insert_stars(s):
    # If the string is empty or has only one character, return it as is
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return s
    # Otherwise, insert '*' between the first character and the rest, then recurse
    else:
        return s[0] + '*' + insert_stars(s[1:])

insert_stars('abc')
```


### 💡 Hint: Recursion


This problem requires you to understand recursion and the differences between iteration and recursion. For reference, check out the [Unit 7 Cheatsheet](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/tip101/unit/7#!cheatsheet).
