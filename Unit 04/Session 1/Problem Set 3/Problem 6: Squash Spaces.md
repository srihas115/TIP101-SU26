# Problem 6: Squash Spaces

The two-pointer approach can also be used with two pointers that iterate forward through a list or string at different rates. Use two pointers to solve the following problem:


Write a function `squash_spaces()` that takes in a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string with each substring with consecutive spaces reduced to a single space. Assume `s` can contain leading or trailing spaces, but in the result should be trimmed.

*Do not use any of the built-in `trim` methods.*


```python
def squash_spaces(s):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
print(squash_spaces("  hello    world  "))
print(squash_spaces("  what  about  this    ?"))
print(squash_spaces("this is my sentence"))
```

Example Output:


```python
hello world
what about this ?
this is my sentence
```
