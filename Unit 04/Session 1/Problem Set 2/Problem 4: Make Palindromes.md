# Problem 4: Make Palindromes

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can **replace a character** in `s` with another lowercase English letter.


Write a function `make_palindrome()` that takes in a string `s` and turns it into a palindrome with the minimum number of operations as possible. If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the **lexicographically smallest** one.


A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (*of the same length*) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.


The function returns the resulting palindrome string.


```python
def make_palindrome(s):
    pass
```

Example 1:


```python
s = "egcfe"
print(make_palindrome(s))
# s_pal == "efcfe"
# The min number of operations to make s a palindrome is 1 by changing `f` to `g`
# another palindrome possible is "egcge", but it is not lexicographically smaller
```

Example 2:


```python
s = "abcd"
print(make_palindrome(s))
# s_pal == "abba"
# The min number of operations to make s a palindrome is 2 by changing `c` to `b` and `d` to `a`
# a palindrome cannot be created in 1 operation
```

Example 3:


```python
s = "seven"
print(make_palindrome(s))
# s_pal == "neven"
# The min number of operations to make s a palindrome is 1 by changing `s` to `n`
# to get a palindrome that is lexographically smaller, it would take more operations
```
