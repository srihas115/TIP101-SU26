# Problem 5: Count Negatives

The **sliding window technique** is an algorithmic technique often used to find a subarray or substring that meets certain criteria. It works by initializing two pointers to point at the start and end of a ‘window’ or subsection of the string/array at a time. The pointers are then incremented to slide the window and examine a different subarray or substring.


Use the sliding window technique to solve the following problem:


Write a function `count_negatives()` that takes in a list of integers `lst` and a positive number `k` as parameters. The function returns a list where each element represents the count of the number of negative values of each sublist of size `k` in `lst`.


```python
def count_negatives(k, nums):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
lst = [-1, 2, -2, 3, 5, -7, -5]
print(count_negatives(lst, 3))
```

Example Output: `[2,1,1,1,2]`


### 💡 Hint: Sliding Window Technique


This problem may require the use of the sliding window technique, an extension of the two-pointer technique. For an in-depth review of the sliding window technique, check out the [Unit 4 Cheatsheet](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/tip101/unit/4#!cheatsheet).
