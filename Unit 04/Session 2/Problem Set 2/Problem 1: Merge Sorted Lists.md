# Problem 1: Merge Sorted Lists

The **two-pointer approach** is a common technique in which we initialize two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. A common variation of this technique is to point one variable at the beginning of one list/string and a second pointer at the beginning of a second list/string, then increment each pointer conditionally to solve a problem.


Using the two pointer approach, write a function `merge_sorted_lists()` that takes in two sorted lists `lst1` and `lst2` as parameters and merges them into a single sorted list. The function returns the new list.


```python
def merge_sorted_lists(lst1, lst2):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
lst1 = [1, 3, 5]
lst2 = [2, 4, 6]
merged_lst = merge_sorted_lists(lst1, lst2)
print(merged_lst)
```

Example Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`


### 💡 Hint: Two Pointer Technique


This problem requires the use of the two pointer technique. For a more in-depth review of the two-pointer technique, check out the [Unit 4 Cheatsheet](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/tip101/unit/4#!cheatsheet), specifically the opposite direction variation.
