# Problem 3: Buildings with an Ocean View

There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an list of integers `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.


The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.


Return a list of indices of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.


```python
def find_buildings(heights):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example #1:
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
xplanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.

Example #2:
Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.

Example #1:
Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
```
