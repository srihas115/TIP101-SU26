# Problem 1: Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, return `True` if the input string is valid and `False` otherwise.


An input string is valid if:


- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


```python
def is_valid(s):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example #1:
Input: s = "()"
Expected Output: True

Example #2:
s = "()[]{}"
Expected Output: True

Example #3:
s = "(())"
Expected Output: True

Example #4:
s = "(]"
Expected Output: False

Example #5:
s = "([)]"
Expected Output: False
```
