# Problem 3: Shuffle Merge

Given the heads of two singly linked lists of integers, merge their nodes to make one list, taking nodes alternately between the two lists. If either list runs out of elements before the other, all nodes from the list with remaining nodes should be appended onto the end of the merged list. Return the head of the merged list.


```python
def shuffle_merge(head_a, head_b):
	pass
```


```python
Input Lists: List 1: 1 —> 2 —> 3, List 2: 4 —> 5 —> 6
Input: head_a = 1, head_b = 4
Expected Return value: 1
Expected Result List: 1 —> 4 —> 2 —> 5 —> 3 —> 6

Input Lists: List 1: 1 —> 2 —> 3, List 2: 4
Expected Return value: 1
Expected Result List: 1 —> 4 —> 2 —> 3
```
