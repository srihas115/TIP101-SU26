# Problem 3: 3-Node Product II

Given the `root` of a binary tree that has at most `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child, return `True` if the value of the root is equal to the product of the values of its two children. Return `False` otherwise. If the `root` has only one child, return `False`.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.

# 10
# Input: root = 10
# Expected Output: True

# Example Input Tree:
#   5
#  / \
# 3   1
# Input: root = 5
# Expected Output: True

# Example Input Tree:
#   5
#    \
#     2
# Input: root = 5
# Expected Output: False

# Example Input Tree: Empty Tree (None)
# Input: root = None
# Expected Output: False
