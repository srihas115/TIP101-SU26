# Problem 3: 3-Node Equality

You are given the `root` of a binary tree that has at most `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.


Return `True` if the root’s children have equal value and `False` otherwise.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
# Example Input Tree:
#      1
#     / \
#    2   2
# Input: root = 1
# Expected Output: True

# Example Input Tree:
#      1
#     /
#    2
# Input: root = 1
# Expected Output: False

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def equality(root):
	pass
```
