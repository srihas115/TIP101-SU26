# Problem 10: BST Descending Leaves

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, write a function `descending_leaves()` that returns a list of the values of all leaves in the BST in descending order. Assume the tree is balanced.


```python
class TreeNode():
     def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
         self.val = val
         self.left = left
         self.right = right

def descending_leaves(root):
	pass
```


```python
Example Input Tree #1:

      4
     / \
    /   \
   2     5
  / \
 1   3

Input: root = 4
Expected Output: [5, 3, 1]

Example Input Tree #2:
 10

Input: root = 4
Expected Output: [10]
```
