# Problem 4: BST Remove I

Use the provided pseudocode to solve the problem below. Given a `key` and the `root` of a binary search tree, remove the node with the given `key`. Return the `root` of the modified tree.


The tree is sorted by `key`. If multiple nodes with the given `key` exist, remove the first node you find. If you need to remove a node with two children, use the in-order successor of that node, which is the smallest value in its right subtree. You do not need to maintain a balanced tree.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
class TreeNode():
     def __init__(self, key, value, left=None, right=None):
		     self.key = key
         self.val = value
         self.left = left
         self.right = right

def remove_bst(root, key):
	# Locate the node to be removed
	# If the node is a leaf node:
		# Remove the node by redirecting the appropriate child reference of its parent to None
	# If the node has one child:
		# Replace the node with its child, updating its parent's nodes child reference appropriately
	# If the node has two children:
		# Find the node's inorder successor (smallest node in right subtree)
		# Swap the value of the node and its inorder successor
		# Recursively remove the successor (which now has the current node's value)
	# Return the root of the updated tree
	pass
```
