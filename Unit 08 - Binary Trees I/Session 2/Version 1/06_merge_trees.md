# Problem 6: Merge Binary Trees

You are given two binary trees with roots root1 and root2.


Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to
merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the
merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.


Return *the merged tree*.


```python
def merge_trees(self, root1, root2):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Trees:

          1                 2
         / \               / \
        /   \             /   \
       3     2           1     3
      /                   \     \
     5                     4     7

Input: root1 = 1, root2 = 2
Expected Output: 3
Expected Output Tree

      3
     / \
    /   \
   4     5
  / \     \
 5   4     7
```
