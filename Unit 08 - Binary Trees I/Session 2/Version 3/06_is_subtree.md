# Problem 6: Nested Binary Trees

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `sub_root`, return `True` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `sub_root` and `False` otherwise.


A subtree of a binary tree is a tree that consists of a node in and all of this node's descendants. The tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.


Evaluate the time complexity of your solution.


```python
class TreeNode():
     def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
         self.val = value
         self.left = left
         self.right = right

def is_subtree(root, sub_root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Trees #1:

      2                3
     / \              / \
    /   \            6   7
   3     5
  / \     \
 6   7     12

Input: root = 2, sub_root = 3
Expected Output: True

Example Input Trees #2:

      2                3
     / \              / \
    /   \            1   2
   3     5
  / \     \
 6   7     12

Input: root = 2, sub_root = 3
Expected Output: False
```
