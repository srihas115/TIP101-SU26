# Problem 4: Merge to Palindrome

Write a function `min_merge_operations()` that takes in a list of non-negative integers `nums` and returns the minimum number of merge operations to make it a palindrome. A merge operation is adding two of the integers.


```python
def min_merge_operations(nums):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
nums = [6,1,3,7]
print(min_merge_operations(nums))

nums2 = [1,3,3,1]
print(min_merge_operations(nums2))

nums3 = [1,3,2,7]
print(min_merge_operations(nums3))
```

Example Output:


```
# merge 6 and 1 to get [7,3,7]
1
# nums2 already a palindrome
0
# need to merge all numbers to [13]
3
```
