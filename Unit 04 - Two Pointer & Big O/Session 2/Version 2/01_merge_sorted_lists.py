  Unit 4: Two Pointer & Big O  ·  Session 2  ·  Version 2
  Problem 1: Merge Sorted Lists

  The **two-pointer approach** is a common technique in which we initialize
  two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different
  indices or places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at
  new indices based on certain conditions. A common variation of this
  technique is to point one variable at the beginning of one list/string and
  a second pointer at the beginning of a second list/string, then increment
  each pointer conditionally to solve a problem.

  Using the two pointer approach, write a function `merge_sorted_lists()`
  that takes in two sorted lists `lst1` and `lst2` as parameters and merges
  them into a single sorted list. The function returns the new list.

  Write your solution for `merge_sorted_lists` in the space below,
  then click  ▶ Run  to grade it.
  (The full problem, with examples, is in the problem set.)

  ⚠️  Keep the function name `merge_sorted_lists` and its parameters exactly as given —
      the problem set solution validator looks for that exact name.
