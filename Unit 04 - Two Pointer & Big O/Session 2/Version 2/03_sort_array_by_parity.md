# Problem 3: Sort List by Parity

Write a function `sort_array_by_parity()` that takes in a list of integers `nums` where half of the integers are odd, and the other half are even. The function sorts the list so that whenever `nums[i]` is odd, `i` is odd and whenever `nums[i]` is even, `i` is even. The function returns the list in any order that satisfies the condition.


```python
def sort_array_by_parity(nums):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
nums = [4,2,5,7]
nums2 = [2,3]
print(sort_array_by_parity(nums))
print(sort_array_by_parity(nums2))
```

Example Output:


```
[4,5,2,7]
# [2,7,4,5], [2,7,4,5], [4,7,2,5] also works
[2,3]
```
