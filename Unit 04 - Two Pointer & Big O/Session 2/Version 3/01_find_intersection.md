# Problem 1: List Intersection

Using the two_pointer approach, write a function `find_intersection()` that takes in two *sorted* lists as parameters and returns a list containing the intersection of the two lists. The intersection list should also be sorted.


The **two-pointer approach** is a common technique in which we initialize two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. A common variation of this technique is to point one variable at the beginning of one list/string and a second pointer at the beginning of a second list/string, then increment each pointer conditionally to solve a problem.


```python
def find_intersection(lst1, lst2):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
lst1 = [1,2,4,6,7]
lst2 = [2,3,4,7]
print(find_intersection(lst1, lst2))
```

Example Output: `[2,4,7]`
