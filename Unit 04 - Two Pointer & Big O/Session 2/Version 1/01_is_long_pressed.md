# Problem 1: Long Pressed

Write a function `is_long_pressed()` that takes in a string `name` and a string `typed` as parameters. Imagine your friend is typing their `name` into a keyboard and when typing a character, the key might get **long pressed** and the character will be typed 1 or more times.


The function should examine the `typed` characters and return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name with some characters being long pressed and `False` otherwise.


Use the **two-pointer approach** to solve the problem, which is a common technique in which we initialize two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. A common variation of this technique is to point one variable at the beginning of one string and a second pointer at the beginning of a second string, then increment each pointer conditionally to solve a problem.


```python
def is_long_pressed(name, typed):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
name = "alex"
typed = "aaleex"
print(is_long_pressed(name, typed))

name2 = "saeed"
typed2 = "ssaaedd"
print(is_long_pressed(name2, typed2))

name3 = "courtney"
typed3 = "courtney"
print(is_long_pressed(name3, typed3))
```

Example Output:


```python
# 'a' and 'e' were long pressed in "alex"
True
# there are two 'e's in "saeed", and only one 'e' in the typed string
False
# equal strings are considered long pressed
True
```
