# Problem 5: Reverse Prefix

Write a function `reverse_prefix()` that takes in a 0-indexed string `word` and a character `ch` as parameters. The function reverses the segment of `word` that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of `ch` (inclusive) and keeps the rest of the string the same. If `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing. Return the resulting string.


```python
def reverse_prefix(word, ch):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
word = "abcdefd"
rev_word = reverse_prefix(word, "d")
print(rev_word)

word2 = "helloworld"
rev_word2 = reverse_prefix(word2, "w")
print(rev_word2)

word3 = "xyzxyz"
rev_word3 = reverse_prefix(word3, "a")
print(rev_word3)
```

Example Output:


```python
dcbaefd
wollehorld
xyzxyz
```
