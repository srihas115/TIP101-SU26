# Problem 2: Two-Pointer Target Sum

Write a function `two_sum()` that takes in a *sorted* list of integers `nums` and an integer `target` as parameters and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the indices in any order.


The function must use the **two-pointer approach**, which is a common technique in which we initialize two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. In the most common variation of the two-pointer approach, we initialize one variable to point at the beginning of a list and a second variable/pointer to point at the end of list. We then shift the pointers to move inwards through the list towards each other, until our problem is solved or the pointers reach the opposite ends of the list.


```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
nums = [2,7,11,15,17]
sol1 = two_sum(nums, 9)
print(sol1)
sol2 = two_sum(nums, 18)
print(sol2)
```

Example Output


```python
[0,1]
[1,2]
```
