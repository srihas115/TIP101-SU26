def ternary_search(lst, target):
    pass
  # Divide the array into three parts using two mid points (mid1 and mid2).

  # While the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:
      # Compare the target value with the values at mid1 and mid2:
          # If the target value matches mid1 or mid2
              # the search is successful.
          # If the target is less than the value at mid1
              # search between the lower bound and mid1 - 1.
          # If the target is between mid1 and mid2
              # search between mid1 + 1 and mid2 - 1.
          # If the target is greater than the value at mid2
              # search between mid2 + 1 and the upper bound.
  # Return -1, indicating the target is not in the array.

# Example Input: lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15], target = 11
