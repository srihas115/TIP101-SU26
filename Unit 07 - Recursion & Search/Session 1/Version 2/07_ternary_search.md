# Problem 7: Ternary Search

Ternary search is a search algorithm that, similar to binary search, works on a sorted array. However, instead of dividing the search interval into two halves (as in binary search), ternary search divides it into three parts, using two midpoints. This reduces the problem size to approximately one-third in each step, rather than one-half.


Given the pseudocode for `ternary_search()` below, implement the function. Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution


```python
def ternary_search(lst, target):
	pass
  # Divide the array into three parts using two mid points (mid1 and mid2).

  # While the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:
	  # Compare the target value with the values at mid1 and mid2:
	      # If the target value matches mid1 or mid2
		      # the search is successful.
	      # If the target is less than the value at mid1
		      # search between the lower bound and mid1 - 1.
	      # If the target is between mid1 and mid2
		      # search between mid1 + 1 and mid2 - 1.
	      # If the target is greater than the value at mid2
		      # search between mid2 + 1 and the upper bound.
  # Return -1, indicating the target is not in the array.
```

Example Usage:


```python
# Example Input: lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15], target = 11
```

Example Output:


```python
# Expected Output: 5
# Explanation: 11 has index 5 in the list
```
