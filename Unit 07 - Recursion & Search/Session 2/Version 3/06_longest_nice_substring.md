# Problem 6: What a Nice String

A string `s` is **nice** if, for every letter of the alphabet that `s` contains, it appears **both** in uppercase and lowercase. For example, `"abABB"` is nice because `'A'` and `'a'` appear, and `'B'` and `'b'` appear. However, `"abA"` is not because `'b'` appears, but `'B'` does not.


Using the divide and conquer approach, write a function `longest_nice_substring()` that takes in a string `s` and returns the longest **substring** of `s` that is **nice**. If there are multiple, return the substring of the **earliest** occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.


```python
def longest_nice_substring(s):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# Example Input: s = "YazaAay"
```

Example Output:


```
# Expected Output: "aAa"
# Explanation:"aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s
# where both 'A' and 'a' appear. "aAa" is the longest nice substring.
```
