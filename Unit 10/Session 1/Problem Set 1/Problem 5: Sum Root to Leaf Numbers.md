# Problem 5: Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.


Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.


- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.


Return *the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers*.


A **leaf** node is a node with no children.


```python
class TreeNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def sum_numbers(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
 Example Input Tree #1:

      1
     / \
    2   3

Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

Example Input Tree #2:

      4
     / \
    9   0
   / \
  5   1

Input: root = 4
Expected Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```
