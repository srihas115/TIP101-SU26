# Problem 2: Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock

You are given a list of integers `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.


You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.


Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.


```python
def max_profit(prices):
	pass
```


```python
Example #1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Expected Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example #2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Expected Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```
