# Problem 4: Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the *length of the **diameter** of the tree.*


The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.


The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def get_diameter(root):
	pass
```


```python
Example Input Tree:

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5

Example Input: root = 1
Output: 3
```
