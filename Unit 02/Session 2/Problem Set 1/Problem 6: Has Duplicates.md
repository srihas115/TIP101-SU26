# Problem 6: Has Duplicates

Write a function `has_duplicates()` that takes in a list of integers `nums` and a positive number `k` as parameters. The function returns `True` if the list contains any duplicate elements within `k` (inclusive) indices of each other. In other words, return `True` if `nums[i]` has the same value as any of the `k` neighboring elements to its left or right. If `k` is greater than the list's length, the solution should check for duplicates in the complete list. The function should return `False` otherwise.


```python
def has_duplicates(nums, k):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
nums = [5, 6, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9]
check1 = has_duplicates(nums, 2)
print(check1)
check2 = has_duplicates(nums, 5)
print(check2)
check3 = has_duplicates(nums, 3)
print(check3)
```

Example Output:


```python
False
True
True
```
