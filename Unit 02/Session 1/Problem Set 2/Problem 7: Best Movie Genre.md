# Problem 7: Best Movie Genre

Imagine you're contributing to a move recommendation engine, and you're tasked with writing a function named `most_popular_genre()` that returns the genre with the highest average rating across all movies.


The function takes in a list of dictionaries named `movies` as a parameter. Each dictionary represents data associated with a movie, including its title, genre, and rating. The function calculates the average rating for each genre and returns the genre with the highest average rating.


```python
def most_popular_genre(movies):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
movies = [
    {"title": "Inception",
     "genre": "Science Fiction",
     "rating": 8.8
    },
    {"title": "The Matrix",
     "genre": "Science Fiction",
     "rating": 8.7
    },
    {"title": "Pride and Prejudice",
     "genre": "Romance",
     "rating": 7.8
    },
    {"title": "Sense and Sensibility",
     "genre": "Romance",
     "rating": 7.7
    }
]

print(most_popular_genre(movies))
```

Example Output: `Science Fiction`
