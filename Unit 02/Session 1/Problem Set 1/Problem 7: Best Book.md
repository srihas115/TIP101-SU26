# Problem 7: Best Book

Imagine you are working on a book review software like [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). Write a function named `highest_rated()` that returns the book with the highest rating.


The function should take in a **list of dictionaries** named `books` as a parameter. Each dictionary represents data associated with a book, including its title, author, and rating. The function should return the dictionary for the book with the highest rating.


```python
def highest_rated(books):
    pass
```

Example Input:


```python
books = [
    {"title": "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow",
     "author": "Gabrielle Zevin",
     "rating": 4.18
    },
    {"title": "A Fortune For Your Disaster",
     "author": "Hanif Abdurraqib",
     "rating": 4.47
    },
    {"title": "The Seven Husbands of Evenlyn Hugo",
     "author": "Taylor Jenkins Reid",
     "rating": 4.40
    }
]
```

Expected Output:


```python
{"title": "A Fortune For Your Disaster",
 "author": "Hanif Abdurraqib",
 "rating": 4.47
}
```
