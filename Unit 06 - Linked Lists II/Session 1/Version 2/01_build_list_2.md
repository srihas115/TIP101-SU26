# Problem 1: One to Many

The assignment statement to the head variable below creates the linked list `Mario -> Luigi -> Wario`. Break apart the assignment statement into multiple lines with one call to the `Node` constructor per line to recreate the list.


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

head = Node("Mario", Node("Luigi", Node("Wario")))
```
