# Problem 7: Insert Value

Write a function `ll_insert()` that takes in a `head` of a linked list, a value `val`, and an index `i` as parameters.


The function should insert a new `Node` with value `val` at index `i` of the linked list, then return the head of the linked list.


- If `i` is greater than the length of the list, insert the new node at the end of the list.


*Hint: Linked lists do not have built-in indices so you will need to track the indices yourself.*


Write a helper function to help you print the new list!


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
		
def ll_insert(head, val, i):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# linked list: 3 -> 8 -> 12 -> 9
ll_insert(head, 20, 2)

# result linked list: 3 -> 8 -> 20 -> 12 -> 9
```
