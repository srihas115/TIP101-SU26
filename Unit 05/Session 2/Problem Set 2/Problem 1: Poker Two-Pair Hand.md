# Problem 1: Poker Two-Pair Hand

In poker, players are given a hand of five cards. A player has a "two-pair" hand if they have two cards of the same rank and another two cards of another rank. The fifth card isn’t used here.


Given the `Card` class below, write a function `is_two_pair()` that takes in a list `player_hand` that contains 5 `Card` objects.


The function returns `True` if the player has a two pair hand and `False` otherwise.


Cards in the hand are guaranteed to be unique and are guaranteed to have on the following suits and ranks:


- The `suit` is one of the following values: `"Hearts"`, `"Spades"`, `"Clubs"`, `"Diamonds"`

- The `rank` is one of the following values: `'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace'`


```python
class Card():
	def  __init__(self, suit, rank):
		self.suit = suit
		self.rank = rank

def is_two_pair(player_hand):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
card_one = Card("Hearts", "Ace")
card_two = Card("Hearts", "4")
card_three = Card("Diamonds", "Ace")
card_four = Card("Diamonds", "4")
card_five = Card("Diamonds", "6")
card_six = Card("Diamonds", "7")

player_one_hand = [card_one, card_two, card_three, card_four, card_five]
print(is_two_pair(player_one_hand))

player_two_hand = [card_two, card_three, card_four, card_five, card_six]
print(is_two_pair(player_two_hand))
```

Example Output:


```python
True  # Two Aces + Two 4s (+ Unused 6)
False # Two 4s (+ Ace + 6 + 7)
```
