# Problem 8: Find Middle Node

Write a function `find_middle_node()` that takes in the `head` of a linked list and returns the "middle" node.


- If the linked list has an even length and there are two "middle" nodes, return the first middle node.

- (E.g., "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4" would return 2, not 3.)


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
		
def find_middle_node(head):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# linked list: num1 -> num2 -> num3 -> num4
head = num1
mid = find_middle_node(head)
# mid == num2
```
