# Problem 3: Insert Value First

Using the `Node` class, write a function `add_first()` that takes in the `head` of a linked list and a value object `val` as parameters.


The function should insert a new `Node` object with value `val` as the new **head** of the linked list and return the new node.


*Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list. Equivalent to lst[0] of a normal list.*


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
		
		
def add_first(head, val):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# Linked List: A -> B -> C
new_list = add_first(node_a, 0)
# New List: 0 -> A -> B -> C
```
