# Problem 3: Insert Node as Second Element

Write a function `add_second()` that takes in the `head` of a linked list and a value object `val` as parameters. It should insert `val` as the second node in the linked list and return the **head** of the linked list. (You can assume `head` is not `None`.)


*Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list. Equivalent to `lst[0]` of a normal list.*


```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

    def add_second(head, val):
        pass
```

Example:


```python
# linked list: 1 -> 3 -> 4
# add_second(head, 2)
# result: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```
