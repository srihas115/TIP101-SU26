# Problem 7: Remove Node by Value from Linked List

Write a function `ll_remove()` that takes in the `head` of a linked list and a value `val` as parameters.


The function should remove the first node it finds in the linked list with value `val` and return the `head` of the linked list. If no node can be found with the value `val`, return the list unchanged.


```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def ll_remove(head, val):
    pass
```

Example:


```python
# Linked List: 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8
# Input: head = 5, val = 6
# Expected Output: 5 -> 7 -> 8
```
