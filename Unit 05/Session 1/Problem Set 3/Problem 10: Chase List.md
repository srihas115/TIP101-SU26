# Problem 10: Chase List

In a linked list, pointers can be redirected at any place in the list.


Using the linked list from Problem 9, create a new Node `dog` with value `"Spike"` and point it to the `cat` node so that the full list now looks like `dog -> cat -> mouse`.


Example Usage:


```python
print(dog.value)
print(dog.next is cat)
print(dog.next.value)
print(cat.next is mouse)
print(cat.next.value)
print(mouse.next)
```

Example Output:


```python
Spike
True
Tom
True
Jerry
None
```
