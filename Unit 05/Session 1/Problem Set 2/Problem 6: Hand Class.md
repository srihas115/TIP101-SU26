# Problem 6: Hand Class

Step 1: Add the following `Hand` class to your code that represents a player's hand of cards.


- A new instance of `Hand` is always empty.


```python
class Hand:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []

    def add_card(self, card):
	    pass
	
	def remove_card(self, card):
		pass
```

Step 2: Add two methods `add_card()` and `remove_card()` to the `Hand` class that each accept a `Card` object as a parameter.


- `add_card()` should add the `Card` to the player's `Hand`

- `remove_card()` should remove the card from the player's `Hand`.


Example Usage:


```python
card_one = Card("Hearts", "3")
card_two = Card("Spades", "8")

player1_hand = Hand()
# cards = []

player1_hand.add_card(card_one)
# cards = [card_one]

player1_hand.add_card(card_two)
# cards = [card_one, card_two]

player1_hand.remove_card(card_one)
# cards = [card_two]
```
