# Problem 8: Print Hand

The class `Card` has been updated below with a new attribute `next` to represent the card that comes after it in a hand of cards.


Write a function `print_hand()` that accepts a `Card` object and returns a list of all cards in the hand that come after it.


```python
class Card():
	def  __init__(self, suit, rank, next = None):
		self.suit = suit
		self.rank = rank
		self.next = next
		
def print_hand(starting_card):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
card_one = Card("Hearts", "3")
card_two = Card("Hearts", "4")
card_three = Card("Diamonds", "King")

card_one.next = card_two
card_two.next = card_three

print_hand(card_one)
```

Example Output: `[card_one, card_two, card_three]`
