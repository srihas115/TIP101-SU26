# Problem 1: Evaluate Mathematical Expression Tree

**Evaluate Mathematical Expression Tree**
You are given the `root` of a **full binary tree** with the following properties:


- **Leaf nodes** have an integer value.

- **Non-leaf nodes** have either the string value `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`


The **evaluation** of a node is as follows:


- If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the **value** of the node, i.e. the integer.

- Otherwise, **evaluate** the node's two children and **apply** the mathematical operation of its value with the children's evaluations.


Return *the boolean result of **evaluating** the* `root` *node.*


A **full binary tree** is a binary tree where each node has either `0` or `2` children.


A **leaf node** is a node that has zero children.


Evaluate the time complexity of the function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def evaluate_tree(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree

        +
      /   \
     /     \
    *       -
   / \     / \
  5   2   60 20

Input: root = +
Expected Output: 50
Explanation:

        +                         +
      /   \                     /  \
     /     \         -->       10  40          -->    50
    *       -
   / \     / \
  5   2   60 20
```
