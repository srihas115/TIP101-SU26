# Problem 4: Second Minimum Value in a Special Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly `two` or `zero` children. If the node has two children, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two children. More formally, the property `root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)` always holds.


Given such a binary tree, write a function that returns the **second minimum** value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.


If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.


Evaluate the time complexity of the function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_second_minimum_value(root):
	pass
```


```python
Example Input Tree #1:

      2
     / \
    2   5
       / \
      5   7

Example Input: root = 2
Expected Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.


Example Input Tree #2:

      2
     / \
    2   2

Example Input: root = 2
Expected Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
```
