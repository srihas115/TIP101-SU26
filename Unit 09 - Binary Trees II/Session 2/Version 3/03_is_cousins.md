# Problem 3: Cousins in Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree `x` and `y`, return `True` *if the nodes corresponding to the values* `x` *and* `y` *in the tree are **cousins**, or* `False` *otherwise.*


Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.


Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at the depth `k + 1`.


Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and give a rationale as to why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_cousins(root, x, y):
	pass
```


```python
Example Input Tree #1:
      1
     / \
    2   3
   /
  4
Input: root = 1, x = 4, y = 3
Expected Output: False

Example Input Tree #2:
      1
     / \
    2   3
     \   \
      4   5
Input: root = 1, x = 5, y = 4
Expected Output: True

Example Input Tree #3:
      1
     / \
    2   3
     \   \
      4   5
Input: root = 1, x = 2, y = 3
Expected Output: False
```
