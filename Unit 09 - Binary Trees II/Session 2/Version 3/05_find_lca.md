# Problem 5: Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes p and `q` in the tree. The LCA is the lowest node `t` that has both `p` and `q` as descendant.
A node can be considered a descendant of itself.


Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and give a rationale as to why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_lca(root, p, q):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree

        3
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
    5       1
   / \     / \
  6   2   0   8
     / \
    7   4

Example input: root = 3, p = 5, q = 1
Expected Output: 3
The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

     / \
    7   4

Example input: root = 3, p = 5, q = 4
Expected Output: 5
The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself.

  <br>

This problem can be solved multiple ways, but may work best with a modified depth first search traversal. To learn more about how to choose a traversal algorithm visit the How to Pick a Traversal Algorithm section of the [Unit 9 Cheatsheet](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/tip101/unit/9#!cheatsheet).
