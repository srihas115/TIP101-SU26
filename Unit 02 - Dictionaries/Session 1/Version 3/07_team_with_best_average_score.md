# Problem 7: Best Team

You're developing an analytics tool for a sports league. Your task is to write a function named `team_with_best_average_score()` that returns the team with the highest average score over a season.


The function should accept a list of dictionaries named `games` as a parameter. Each dictionary represents data from a game, including the `"team_name"`, and the `"score"` they achieved in that game. The function calculates the average score for each team across all games and returns the team with the highest average score.


```python
def team_with_best_average_score(games):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
games = [
    {"team_name": "Lions",
     "score": 23
    },
    {"team_name": "Tigers",
     "score": 30
    },
    {"team_name": "Lions",
     "score": 27
    },
    {"team_name": "Bears",
     "score": 20
    },
    {"team_name": "Tigers",
     "score": 24
    },
    {"team_name": "Bears",
     "score": 22
    }
]

print(team_with_best_average_score(games))
```

Example Output: `Tigers`
