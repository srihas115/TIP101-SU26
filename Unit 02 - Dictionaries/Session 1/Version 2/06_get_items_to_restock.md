# Problem 6: Items to Restock

Write a function `get_items_to_restock()` that takes in a dictionary `products` that maps product names to their quantities and an integer `restock_threshold` as parameters. The function returns a list of products that have a value less than `restock_threshold` and need to be restocked. If `products` is empty, the function return an empty list.


```python
def get_items_to_restock(products, restock_threshold):
    pass
```

Example Input:


```python
products = {"Product1": 10, "Product2": 2, "Product3": 5, "Product4": 3}
restock_threshold = 5
```

Example Output: `['Product2', 'Product4']`
