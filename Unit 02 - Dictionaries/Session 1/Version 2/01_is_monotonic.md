# Problem 1: Is Monotonic

Write a function `is_monotonic()` that takes in a list `nums` as a parameter and checks if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

A list is monotone increasing if every element is either greater than or equal to the element before it.

A list is monotone decreasing if every element is either less than or equal to the element before it.

The function should return `True` if the given list is either monotone increasing or decreasing and `False` otherwise.

*Hint: This is a **lists** problem*


```python
def is_monotonic(nums):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
nums1 = [1,2,2,3,10]
print(is_monotonic(nums1))

nums2 = [12,9,8,3,1]
print(is_monotonic(nums2))

nums3 = [1,1,1]
print(is_monotonic(nums3))

nums4 = [1,9,8,3,5]
print(is_monotonic(nums4))
```

Example Output:


```
True
True
True
False
```

As a review from the previous unit, this question is a lists question! You do not need to know anything about dictionaries to solve this problem.
