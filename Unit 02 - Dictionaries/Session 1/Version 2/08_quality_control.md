# Problem 8: Quality Control

Write a function `quality_control()` that takes in a dictionary `product_scores` and an integer `threshold` as parameters. The dictionary `product_scores` has key-value pairs that represent a product ID and its quality rating.

If the product has a score greater than or equal to `threshold`, the function categorizes it as a `"pass"`.

If the product has a score less than `threshold`, the function categorizes it as a `"fail"`.

The function returns a new dictionary where the key-value pair is the product ID and whether it is a `"pass"` or `"fail"`.


```python
def quality_control(product_scores, threshold):
    pass
```

Example Input:


```python
product_scores = {"x0123": 75, "x0124": 40, "x0125": 90, "x0126": 55}
threshold = 60
print(quality_control(product_scores, threshold))
```

Example Output: `{'x0123': 'pass', 'x0124': 'fail', 'x0125': 'pass', 'x0126': 'fail'}`
