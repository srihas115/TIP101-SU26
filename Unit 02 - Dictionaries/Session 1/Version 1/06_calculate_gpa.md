# Problem 6: Calculate GPA

Write a function `calculate_gpa()` that calculates the grade point average (GPA) for a student based on their course grades and returns the `gpa` as a float. The function takes in a dictionary `report_card` as a parameter where each key-value pair represents a course and the grade received in that course respectively. The grades are represented as strings (`"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, `"D"`, `"F"`) and each grade corresponds to a certain number of grade points:


`"A"` = 4

`"B"` = 3

`"C"` = 2

`"D"` = 1

`"F"` = 0


A GPA is calculated by finding the average of all grade points.


```python
def calculate_gpa(report_card):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
report_card = {"Math": "A", "Science": "C", "History": "A", "Art": "B", "English": "B", "Spanish": "A"}
print(calculate_gpa(report_card))
```

Example Output: `3.3333333333333335`
