# Problem 7: Make Pairs

Write a function `divide_list()` that takes in an integer list `nums` consisting of `2*n` integers as parameters. The function divides `nums` into `n` pairs such that:


- Each element belongs to exactly one pair

- The elements present in a pair are equal


Return `True` if `nums` can be divided into `n` pairs, otherwise return `False`.


```python
def divide_list(nums):
    pass
```

Example Input:


```python
nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
print(divide_list(nums))
```

Example Output: `True`

Explanation: There are 6 elements in `nums`, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.
If `nums` is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.


Example Input:


```python
nums = [1,2,3,4]
print(divide_list(nums))
```

Example Output: `False`

Explanation: There is no way to divide `nums` into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.
