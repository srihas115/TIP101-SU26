# Problem 6: How Many Smaller

Write a function `smaller_numbers_than_current()` that takes in a list of numbers `nums` as a parameter. For each `nums[i]`, the function should find out how many numbers in the list are smaller than it. (*For each nums[i], count the number of valid `j`'s such that `j!=i` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`*)


Return the answers in a list.


```python
def smaller_numbers_than_current(nums):
    pass
```

Example Input:


```python
nums = [6,1,2,2,3]
print(smaller_numbers_than_current(nums))
```

Example Output: `[4,0,1,1,3]`


Explanation:


```python
nums[0] == 6
There exists four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3) --> ans[0]=4

nums[1] == 1
There does not exist any smaller number than it --> ans[1]=0

nums[2] == 2
There exists one smaller number than it (1) --> ans[2]=1

nums[3] == 2
There exists one smaller number than it (1) --> ans[3]=1

nums[4] == 3
There exists three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2) --> ans[4]=3
```
