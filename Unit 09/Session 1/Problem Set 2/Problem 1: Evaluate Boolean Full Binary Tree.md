# Problem 1: Evaluate Boolean Full Binary Tree

You are given the `root` of a **full binary tree** with the following properties:


- **Leaf nodes** have either the boolean value `True` or `False` .

- **Non-leaf nodes** have either the string value `OR` or `AND`.


The **evaluation** of a node is as follows:


- If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the **value** of the node, i.e. `True` or `False`.

- Otherwise, **evaluate** the node's two children and **apply** the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.


Return *result of **evaluating** the* `root` *node.*
Return the result of evaluating the root nod


A **full binary tree** is a binary tree where each node has either `0` or `2` children.


A **leaf node** is a node that has zero children.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def evaluate_tree(root):
	pass
```


```python
Example Input Tree #1:

       OR
      /  \
     /    \
  True    AND
         /   \
       False True

Input: root = OR
Expected Output: True
Explanation:

       OR                       OR
      /  \                     /  \
     /    \         -->       /    \          -->    True
  True    AND               True   False
         /   \
       False True
```
