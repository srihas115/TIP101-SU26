# Problem 3: Kth Smallest node in a BST

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a positive integer `k`, return the value of the `kth` smallest node in the tree. All nodes in the tree are guaranteed to be unique.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def kth_smallest(root, k):
	pass
```


```python
Example Input Tree

          15
         /  \
        /    \
       /      \
      10      20
     /  \     / \
    8   12   16 26

Example Input: root = 15, k = 4
Expected Output: 15
Explanation: The 4th smallest value is 15.
