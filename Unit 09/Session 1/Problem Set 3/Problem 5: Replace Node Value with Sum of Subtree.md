# Problem 5: Replace Node Value with Sum of Subtree

Given a binary tree, in-place replace each node’s value as the sum of all elements present in its left and right subtree. You may assume the value of an empty child node to be 0.


Return the root of the modified tree.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def sum_transform(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree

            1
           / \
          /   \
         /     \
        2       3
         \     / \
          4    5  6
              / \
             7   8

Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: root = 35
Expected Output Tree:

            35
           /  \
          /    \
         /      \
        4       26
         \      / \
          0    15  0
              / \
             0   0
```
