# Problem 4: Check Balanced Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return `True` if the tree is balanced and `False` otherwise.


A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_balanced(root):
	pass
```


```python
Example Input Tree #1:

      3
     /  \
    9   20
       /  \
      15   7

Example Input: root = 3
Expected Output: True

Example Input Tree #2:

          1
         / \
        2   2
       / \
      3   3
     / \
    4   4

Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: False

Example Input Tree: Empty Tree
Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: True
```
