# Problem 2: Root-to-Leaf Paths

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return a list of *all root-to-leaf paths in **any order***.


A **leaf** is a node with no children.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def binary_tree_paths(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree #1:

  1
 / \
2   3
 \
  5

Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]
["1->3", "1->2->5"] is also valid

Example Input Tree #2:

  1

Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: ["1"]
```
