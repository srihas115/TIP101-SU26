# Problem 1: Is Symmetric Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return `True` if the tree’s left and right subtrees are mirrors of each other (i.e., tree is symmetric around its center). Return `False` otherwise.


Evaluate the time complexity of your function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_symmetric(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Tree #1:

       1
     /   \
    /     \
   2       2
  / \     / \
 3   4   4   3


Input: root = 1
Expected Output: True


Example Tree #2:

        1
      /   \
     /     \
    2       2
     \       \
      3       3


Input: root = 1
Expected Output: False
```
