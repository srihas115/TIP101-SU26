# Problem 5: Equal Tree Split

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return `True` if removing an edge between two nodes can split the tree into two trees with an equal number of nodes. Return `False` otherwise.


Evaluate the time complexity of the function.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def can_split(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree #1:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    2     3
   / \     \
  4   5     7

Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: True
Explanation: Deleting the edge between node 1 and its left child, node 2 gives the following
two trees, each of size 3

  Tree 1    Tree 2
              1
               \
    2           3
   / \           \
  4   5           7


Example Input Tree #2:

       1
      /  \
     /    \
    2      3
   / \    / \
  4   5  6   7

Example Input: root = 1
Expected Output: False
Explanation: It is not possible to split the tree into two trees of equal size by deleting
an edge
