# Problem 2: Sum of Node Values by Level in Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return a list of the sums of node values in each level in the binary tree.


Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and give a rationale as to why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def level_sum(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree

      4
     / \
    2   6
   / \
  1   3

Example Input: root = 4
Expected Output: [4, 8, 4]
Explanation:
Level 1: 4
Level 2: 2 + 6 = 8
Level 3: 1 + 3 = 4
```
