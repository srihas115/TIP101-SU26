# Problem 5: Find the Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the *length of the **diameter** of the tree.*


The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.


The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_diameter(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree:

     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \
 4   5

Example Input: root = 1
Output: 3
3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3]
```


### 💡 Hint: Choosing your Traversal Method


This problem can be solved multiple ways, but may work best with a modified depth first search traversal.
