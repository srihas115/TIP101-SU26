# Problem 5: Sum of Binary Tree Node Tilts

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node’s tilt.
The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as `0`. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.


Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and give a rationale as to why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def find_tilt(root):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
Example Input Tree #1:

     1
    / \
   2   3

Input: root = 1
Expected Output: 1
Explanation
Tilt of node 2: |0 - 0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1


Example Input Tree #2:

      4
     / \
    2   9
   / \   \
  3   5   7

Example Input: root = 4
Expected Output: 15
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
```


### ✨ AI Hint: Absolute Value


*Key Skill: Use AI to explain code concepts*


To solve this problem, it may be helpful to know how to easily find the **absolute value** of a number. For reference, check out the [Unit 9 Cheatsheet](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/tip101/unit/9#!cheatsheet).


For more help, you can use an AI tool like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to explain what absolute value is, and how to calculate the absolute value of a number in Python.


### 💡 Hint: Choosing your Traversal Method


This problem can be solved multiple ways, but may work best with a modified depth first search traversal.
