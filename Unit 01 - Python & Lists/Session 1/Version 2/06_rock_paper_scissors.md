# Problem 6: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Write a function `rock_paper_scissors()` that determines the winner of a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The function accepts two strings as parameters: `player1` and `player2`. Each parameter can have a value of `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`.


Print either `"Player 1 wins!"` or `"Player 2 wins!"` according to the following rules:

Rock wins against scissors.

Scissors wins against paper.

Paper wins against rock.


If both `player1` and `player2` have the same value, print `"It's a tie!"`.


```python
def rock_paper_scissors(player1, player2):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
rock_paper_scissors("rock", "rock")
rock_paper_scissors("scissors", "rock")
rock_paper_scissors("scissors", "paper")
rock_paper_scissors("rock", "paper")
rock_paper_scissors("paper", "rock")
```

Example Output:


```
It's a tie!
Player 2 wins!
Player 1 wins!
Player 2 wins!
Player 1 wins!
```
