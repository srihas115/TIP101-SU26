# Problem 8: Blackjack

In the game Blackjack, players try to draw a hand of cards that totals as close to 21 as possible. Players "bust" if their cards total more than 21. Players say "Hit me!" if they want the dealer to give them another card.


Write a function called `blackjack()` that takes an integer `score` as a parameter.

If `score` equals 21, print `"Blackjack!"`.

If `score` is greater than 21, print `"Bust!"`.

If `score` is greater than or equal to 17 and less than 21, print `"Nice hand!"`.

If `score` is less than 17, print `"Hit me!"`.


Example Usage:


```python
blackjack(21)
blackjack(24)
blackjack(19)
blackjack(10)
```

Output:


```
Blackjack!
Bust!
Nice hand!
Hit me!
```
