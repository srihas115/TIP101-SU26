# Problem 5: Where Do We Begin?

A linked list contains a cycle if the tail element points back to another element in the list. Given the head of a linked list, use the fast and slow pointer method to determine the node where the cycle starts. If the linked list does not contain a cycle, return `None`.


Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.


```python
class Node:
   def __init__(self, value, next=None):
       self.value = value
       self.next = next

def get_loop_start(head):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# Input List:
# 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
#      ^         |
#      |---------|
# Input: head = 1
```

Example Output:


```python
# Output: 2
```


### ✨ AI Hint: Multiple Pass Technique


*Key Skill: Use AI to explain code concepts*


This problem may require multiple traversals of the list. For reference, check out the [Unit 6 Cheatsheet](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/tip101/unit/6#!cheatsheet).


For more help, you can use an AI tool like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to show you examples of the multiple pass technique.
