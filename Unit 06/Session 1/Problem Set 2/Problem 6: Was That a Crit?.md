# Problem 6: Was That a Crit?

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the number of critical points. A critical point is a local minima or maxima.
- The head and tail nodes are not considered critical points.
- A node is a local minima if both the next and previous elements are greater than the current element
- A node is a local maxima if both the next and previous elements are less than the current element.


Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.


```python
class Node:
   def __init__(self, value, next=None):
       self.value = value
       self.next = next

def count_critical_points(head):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# Input List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3
# Input: head = 3
```

Example Output:


```python
# Expected Return Value: 2
# Explanation:
#  - Critical point 1 (local maxima) 3 -> 5 -> 1
#  - Critical point 2 (local minima): 5 -> 1 -> 3
```


### 💡 Hint: Which technique?


This is not a slow-fast pointer problem! This problem does not require a specific technique, but will require you to apply your skills to learn from and extend problem solving patterns you've encountered previously.
