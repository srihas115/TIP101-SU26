# Problem 7: Get Pokemon

Outside the Pokemon class, write a new function `get_by_type()` that takes in a list of Pokemon instances `my_pokemon` and a string `pokemon_type` as parameters.


The function should return a list of all Pokemon instances from `my_pokemon` that have the type `pokemon_type`.


*Hint: To test, loop over Pokemon in return list and print the Pokemon's name*


```python
class Pokemon():
	...
	
def get_by_type(my_pokemon, pokemon_type):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# initializing pokemons
jigglypuff = Pokemon("Jigglypuff", ["Normal", "Fairy"])
diglett = Pokemon("Diglett", ["Ground"])
meowth = Pokemon("Meowth", ["Normal"])
pidgeot = Pokemon("Pidgeot", ["Normal", "Flying"])
blastoise = Pokemon("Blastoise", ["Water"])

my_pokemon = [jigglypuff, diglett, meowth, pidgeot, blastoise]
normal_pokemon = get_by_type(my_pokemon, "Normal")
print(normal_pokemon)
```

Example Output: `[Jigglypuff, Meowth, Pidgeot]`
