# Problem 7: Sum of Cards

Write a function `sum_hand()` that takes in an instance of `Hand` as a parameter and returns the summed value of all cards in the hand.


- Use the methods from Problems 5-7 to assist you.

- If any card in the hand is invalid, return `None`.


```python
class Card():
    def  __init__(self, suit, rank):
		self.suit = suit
		self.rank = rank
		
	#... methods from previous problems

class Hand:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []

	# ... methods from previous problems
		
	
def sum_hand(hand):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
card_one = Card("Hearts", "3")
card_two = Card("Hearts", "Jack")
card_three = Card("Spades", "3")

hand = Hand()
hand.add_card(card_one)
hand.add_card(card_two)
hand.add_card(card_three)

sum = sum_hand(hand)
print(sum)
```

Example Output: `17`
