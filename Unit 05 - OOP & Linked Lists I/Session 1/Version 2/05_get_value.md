# Problem 5: Get Value

Update the `Card` class with a new method `get_value()` that takes in no parameters except `self`.


The function returns the card's value depending on the card's `rank`:


- If the card has rank `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, the method should return the rank as an integer

- If the card has rank `Ace`, the method should return `1` as the card's value

- If the card has rank `Jack`, the method should return `11` as the card's value

- If the card has rank `Queen`, the method should return `12` as the card's value

- If the card has rank `King`, the method should return `13` as the card's value

- If the card is invalid, the method should return `None`


```python
class Card():
	...
	
	def get_value(self):
		pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
card = Card("Hearts", "7")
print(card.get_value())

card_two = Card("Spades", "Jack")
print(card_two.get_value())
```

Example Output:


```python
7
11
```
