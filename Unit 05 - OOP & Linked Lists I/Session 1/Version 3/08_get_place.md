# Problem 8: Get Rank

The `Player` class has been updated below with a new attribute `ahead` to represent the player currently directly ahead of them in the race.


Write a function `get_rank()` that accepts a `Player` object `my_player` and returns their current place number in the race.


```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, character, kart, opponent=None):
        self.character = character
        self.kart = kart
        self.items = []
        self.ahead = opponent

def get_place(my_player):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
peach = Player("Peach", "Daytripper")
mario = Player("Mario", "Standard Kart M", peach)
luigi = Player("Luigi", "Super Blooper", mario)

player1_rank = get_place(luigi)
print(player1_rank)

player2_rank = get_place(peach)
print(player2_rank)

player3_rank = get_place(mario)
print(player3_rank)
```

Example Output:


```
3
1
2
```
