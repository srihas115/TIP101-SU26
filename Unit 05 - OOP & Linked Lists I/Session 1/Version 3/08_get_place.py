  Write your solution in the space provided below, then click ▶ Run to validate it.
  (Full instructions and examples are in the problem set.)

  ⚠️  Keep every class, method, and function name exactly as the problem gives it,
      and use the exact variable names it asks for — the problem set solution validator looks those up
      by name (they're case-sensitive). If it can't find one, the results will tell
      you which name is missing.
