# Problem 11: Update Chase

Using the linked list from Problem 10, remove the `dog` node and add in a node `cheese` with value `"Gouda"` to the end of the list so that the resulting list is `cat -> mouse -> cheese`.


Using the linked list from Problem 10 (currently `dog -> cat -> mouse`, where `dog.value == "Spike"`, `cat.value == "Tom"`, and `mouse.value == "Jerry")`, remove the `dog` node from the chain and add a node `cheese` with value `"Gouda"` to the end of the list so the resulting list is:


`cat -> mouse -> cheese`.


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
```
