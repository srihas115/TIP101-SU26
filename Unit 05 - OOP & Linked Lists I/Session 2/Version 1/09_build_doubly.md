# Problem 9: Doubly Linked List

One of the drawbacks of a linked list is that it's difficult to go backwards, because each `Node` only knows about the `Node` in front of it. (E.g., `A -> B -> C`)


A **doubly linked list** solves this problem! Instead of just having a `next` attribute, a doubly linked list also has a `prev` attribute that points to the `Node` before it. (E.g., `A <-> B <-> C`)


Given the `Node` class for a doubly linked list below, recreate the list `["Poliwag", "Poliwhirl", "Poliwrath"]` as a doubly linked list.


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next = None, prev = None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
		self.prev = prev
```

Example Usage: (*after completing the problem with variable names `poliwag`, `poliwhirl`, and `poliwrath`*):


```python
print(poliwhirl.prev.value, "<->", poliwhirl.value, "<->", poliwhirl.next.value)
```

Example Output:


```python
Poliwag <-> Poliwhirl <-> Poliwrath
```
