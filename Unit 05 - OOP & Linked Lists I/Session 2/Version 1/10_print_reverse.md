# Problem 10: Print Backwards

Write a function `print_reverse()` that takes in the `tail` of a doubly linked list as a parameter.


It should print out the values of the linked list in reverse order, each separated by a space.


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next = None, prev = None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
		self.prev = prev
		
def print_reverse(tail):
	pass
```

Example Usage: (*using the doubly linked list from Problem 9*)


```python
#              (head)                       (tail)
# Linked List: Poliwag <-> Poliwhirl <-> Poliwrath
print_reverse(poliwrath)
```

Example Output: `Poliwrath Poliwhirl Poliwag`
