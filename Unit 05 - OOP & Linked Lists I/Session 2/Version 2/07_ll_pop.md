# Problem 7: Pop Node

Write a function `ll_pop()` that takes in the `head` of a linked list and an index `i` as parameters.


The function should remove the node at index `i` of the linked list and return the `head` of the list.


- If `i` is greater than the length of the list, do nothing.


*Hint: Linked lists do not have built-in indices so you will need to track the indices yourself.*


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
		
def ll_pop(head, i):
	pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# linked list: num1 -> num2 -> num3
ll_pop(num1, 1)
# result: num1 -> num3
```
