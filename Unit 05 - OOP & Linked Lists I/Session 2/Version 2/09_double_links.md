# Problem 9: Create Double Links

One of the drawbacks of a linked list is that it's difficult to go backwards, because each `Node` only knows about the `Node` in front of it. (E.g., `A -> B -> C`)


A **doubly linked list** solves this problem! Instead of just having a `next` attribute, a doubly linked list also has a `prev` attribute that points to the `Node` before it. (E.g., `A <-> B <-> C`)


Update the `Node` constructor below so that the code creates a doubly linked list with `head <-> tail`.


```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next = None):
	    self.value = value
	    self.next = next

head = Node("First")
tail = Node("Last")

head.next = tail
tail.prev = head
```

Example Usage:


```python
print(head.value, "<->", head.next.value)
print(tail.prev.value, "<->", tail.value)
```

Example Output:


```python
First <-> Last
First <-> Last
```
