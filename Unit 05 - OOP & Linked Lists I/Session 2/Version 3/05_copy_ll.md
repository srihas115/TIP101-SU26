# Problem 5: Copy Linked List

Write a function `copy_ll()` that takes in the `head` of a linked_list, and creates a complete **copy** of that linked list.


The function should return the `head` of a new linked list which is identical to the given list in terms of its structure and contents, but does not use any of the node objects from the original list.


```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def copy_ll(head):
    pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
# Linked List: 5 -> 6 -> 7
copy = copy_ll(head) # Linked List Copy: 5 -> 6 -> 7
print(head.value, copy.value)

# Change original list -- should not affect the copy
head.value = 10
print(head.value, copy.value)
```

Example Output:


```python
5 5
10 5
```
