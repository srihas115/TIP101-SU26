# Problem 1: Calculate Tournament Placement

In the `Player` class below, each player has a `race_outcomes` attribute which holds a list of integers describing what place they came in for each race in a tournament.


Write a method `get_tournament_place()` that takes in one parameter `opponents`, a list of other player objects also participating in the tournament, and returns the place in the overall tournament.


- Rank in the tournament is determined by the **lowest** average race outcome. (1st place is better than 2nd!)

- Each opponent in `opponents` is guaranteed to have participated in the same number of races as the current player.


```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, character, kart, outcomes):
        self.character = character
        self.kart = kart
        self.items = []
        self.race_outcomes = outcomes

    def get_tournament_place(self, opponents):
        pass
```

Example Usage:


```python
player1 = Player("Mario", "Standard", [1, 2, 1, 1, 3])
player2 = Player("Luigi", "Standard", [2, 1, 3, 2, 2])
player3 = Player("Peach", "Standard", [3, 3, 2, 3, 1])

opponents = [player2, player3]
print(f"{player1.character} was number {player1.get_tournament_place(opponents)}")
```

Example Output:


```
Mario was number 1 # Mario's average place is 1.6, Luigi's is 2.0, and Peach's is 2.4
```
